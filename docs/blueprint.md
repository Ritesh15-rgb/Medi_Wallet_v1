## Original User Request:
I want to create a professional app called "Medical Record Keeper" using Firebase Studio.

The app should allow patients to:

Sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication (email, Google).

Upload medical records such as prescriptions and reports (PDF or image formats).

Store these records securely in Firebase Cloud Storage.

Save related metadata (e.g., doctor name, date of upload, type of report) in Firebase Firestore.

View and access previously uploaded reports from their account.

Search and filter records by date or doctor name using Firestore queries.

ðŸ“Œ Additional Notes:

Each user should only be able to view their own documents (use Firebase Security Rules).

Include a profile page with basic info (name, contact).

Create a clean and minimal UI with navigation between Home, Upload, View, Search, and Profile.

Use Firebase Firestore to store structured document metadata.

Please help me structure the app screens and connect them with the appropriate Firebase backend services.
